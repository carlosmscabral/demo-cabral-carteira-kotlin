# Risk Assessment: Carteira do Cabral

Score: 65/100

## Red Flags
- [HIGH] The expense tracker market is one of the most crowded in app stores, making organic discovery nearly impossible without significant ad spend.: Aggressive niche branding targeting 'Privacy Paranoiacs' and 'Android Power Users' who specifically reject bank-sync apps.
- [CRITICAL] Regardless of speed, manual tracking relies on user discipline. Statistically, most users stop logging expenses after 14-21 days.: Double down on the '1-Click' widget and geofencing to make input as effortless as possible.
- [MEDIUM] Excluding iOS users cuts out a demographic generally more willing to pay for premium productivity apps.: Eventually pivot to a cross-platform framework or market specifically as a native 'Android-First' luxury tool.
- [HIGH] Users are unlikely to pay a recurring subscription for a tool that tells them they are overspending.: Implement a one-time 'Pro' unlock for advanced charts and CSV export rather than a subscription.
